## Web Design Challenge

This homework assigment used data from the Python API homework challenge to create a web site with visualizations 
for max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

The asset images included in the homework project folder were not used.  Citipy library and 
OpenWeather API were used to collect new data for cities.  New plots were created using Matplotlib.


### Latitude Website

Here is the live link to the website:[Latitude Website](https://kaicee2010.github.io/web-design-challenge/WebVisualizations/index.html)  

The Latitude website contains the following pages:
- Latitude (index.html)
- Plots
    - Max Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Cloudiness
    - Wind Speed
- Comparison 
- Data

For the bonus, a map of city location was creating using Gmaps.  Heat maps were created for each aspect of the weather.  The pages created are:
- City Locations
- Heat Map - Max Temperature
- Heat Map - Humidity
- Heat Map - Cloudiness
- Heat Map - Wind Speed
