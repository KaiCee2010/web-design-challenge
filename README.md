## Web Design Challenge

This homework assigment used data from the Python API homework challenge to create a web site with visualizations 
for max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

The asset images included in the homework project folder were not used.  Citipy library and 
OpenWeather API were used to collect new data for cities.  New plots were created in pandas using Matplotlib.


### Latitude Website

Here is the live link to the website: [Latitude Website](https://kaicee2010.github.io/web-design-challenge/WebVisualizations/index.html)  

The Latitude website contains the following pages:
- Latitude (index.html)
    - Displays the main project page which includes a summary of the project and links to visualizations.
- Max Temperature (maxtemps.html)
    - Displays the max temperature visualization and links to other visualizations.  The current page is shown as active.
- Humidity (humidity)
    - Displays the humidity visualization and links to other visualizations.  The current page is shown as active.
- Cloudiness (cloudiness.html)
    - Displays the cloudiness visualization and links to other visualizations.  The current page is shown as active.
- Wind Speed (wind_speed.html)
    - Displays the wind speed visualization and links to other visualizations.  The current page is shown as active.
- Comparison (comparison.html)
        - Displays the all four visualizations. Each visualization is a link to their individual page.
- Data (data.html)
        - Displays the source tabular data for the project.

For the bonus, a map of city location was creating using Gmaps.  Heat maps were created for each aspect of the weather.  The pages created are:
- City Locations  (map_city_locations)
    - Displays the map of city locations used for the project.
- Heat Map - Max Temperature (map_maxtemps.html)
    - Displays the heat map of max temperatures and links to other heat maps.  The current page is shown as active.
- Heat Map - Humidity (map_humidity.html)
    - Displays the heat map of humidity and links to other heat maps.  The current page is shown as active.
- Heat Map - Cloudiness (map_cloudiness.html)
    - Displays the heat map of cloudiness and links to other heat maps.  The current page is shown as active.
- Heat Map - Wind Speed (map_wind_speed.html)
    - Displays the heat map of wind speed and links to other heat maps.  The current page is shown as active.
